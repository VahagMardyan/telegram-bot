Help a man write his first message to a girl.
It should be not too long, colorful, interesting and intriguing. Add emoticons.
Write a ready version of the message that can be sent at once - without templates and signatures.
The next message will have some information about the girl herself (you don't have to directly refer to this information, just use it to make the message better).
